# Sierpinski Triangle Project

## Introduction

This project is a Python implementation of generating the Sierpinski Triangle fractal using recursive algorithm.

## Description

The Sierpinski Triangle, named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, is a fractal shape that consists of equilateral triangles nested within each other in a repeating, self-similar pattern. It is a fascinating example of a mathematical construct that exhibits infinite complexity despite being generated by simple rules.

This project provides Python code to generate the Sierpinski Triangle using recursive approache:

**Recursion:** The recursive approach involves subdividing a triangle into smaller triangles and recursively applying the same process to each of the smaller triangles until a base case is reached.

## Features

- **Recursive Algorithm:** Implementing the Sierpinski Triangle using a recursive approach, which is elegant and intuitive.
- **Visualization:** Providing options for visualizing the generated Sierpinski Triangle using popular plotting libraries like Matplotlib.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SemirBaldzhiev/Sierpinski-Triangle-Project


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd sierpinski-triangle


3. Run the Python script to generate the Sierpinski Triangle:

python fractal.py

4. Enter the level of the Sierpiński triangle from the console (should be non-negative integer in range [0-6] (for better view))

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle
